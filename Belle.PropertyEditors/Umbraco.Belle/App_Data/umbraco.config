<p>Umbraco modules encapsulate specific bits of advanced
functionality that are easily added to your website.</p>

<p>Once installed, Umbraco modules are open source and easy to
customize if you want to modify the behavior for your specific

<strong>Settings</strong> section, expand the
<strong>Templates</strong> item, select the <strong>Starterkit

<p>The Simple Starter Kit only scratches the surface of what's
possible with Umbraco. Below the Simple Starter Kit and its modules
lies a great architecture that lets you implement whatever you
need.</p>

<p>With Umbraco you've finally got a solid, open and reliable
platform for websites as basic as the Simple site, and Umbraco can
be rapidly expanded to support multi-language websites,
collaboration platforms and intra/extranets, to name just a
few.</p>

<p>Advanced functionality is created with Umbraco macros, built
with XSLT and Umbraco's award-winning .NET integration, including
full support for any .NET User or Custom control. Create and
integrate your own .NET macros in mere minutes with point and click
simplicity. Simply copy your controls to the Umbraco website, go to
the <strong>Developer</strong> section and create a new macro,
selecting your control from the list.</p>

<p>You can also use <a
href="http://umbraco.org/help-and-support/video-tutorials/getting-started/working-with-webmatrix"
 title="Working with Razor">Microsoft's Razor</a> syntax to quickly
add dynamic functionality to your site.</p>

<p>We've also gathered the best community macros into a repository
that's also accessed from the <strong>Developer</strong> section,
in the <strong>Packages</strong> area. You can find more
information <a
href="http://umbraco.org/help-and-support/video-tutorials/introduction-to-umbraco/sitebuilder-introduction/what-are-macros"
 title="About creating Umbraco macros">about creating macros</a>,
on the Umbraco website.</p>

<p>The sky is the limit with Umbraco, and you have the benefit a
friendly community, training, and guaranteed support. Find out how

<p>You've installed Umbraco and the basic Simple website.</p>

<p>Edit the text on the homepage and create a site structure by
adding new texpages to your site. This is all done in the
<strong>Content</strong> section.</p>

<p>If you find the editing options provided by the Simple site too
limited for you needs, simply add more properties to the page by
going to the <strong>Settings</strong> section, expanding the
<strong>Document Types</strong> item and adding new properties on
the <strong>Generic Properties</strong> tab. You can find more
information about <a
href="http://umbraco.org/help-and-support/video-tutorials/introduction-to-umbraco/sitebuilder-introduction/document-types"
 title="About Umbraco Document Types">document types and
properties</a> at the <a href="http://umbraco.org"
title="The Umbraco Website">Umbraco website</a>.</p>

<p>You'll probably want to personalize your site by changing the
current design. This is also done in the <strong>Settings</strong>
section, either by editing the CSS styles and HTML templates or by
selecting and applying a Skin. Umbraco uses master templates, so
the main, common markup is placed in the <strong>Starterkit
Master</strong> template, while the Homeage and Textpage have
separate templates for their unique layouts. You can find more
information about <a

 title="Umbraco Templates and Stylesheets">templates and css</a> in
umbraco at the umbraco website.</p>

<p>Once you're happy with your site's design, you might want to add
more functionality, such as automated navigation. This is done by

<p>The Simple Starter Kit gives you a bare-bones website that
introduces you to a set of well-defined conventions for building an
Umbraco website.</p>

<p>The Simple website is very basic in form and provided without
any design or functionality - unless you add a Skin, of course. By
installing the Simple Starter Kit, you'll begin with a minimal site
built on best practices. You'll also enjoy the benefits of speaking
the same "language" as the rest of the Umbraco community by using
common properties and naming conventions.</p>

<p>Now that you know what the Simple site is, it is time to get
started using Umbraco.</p>
